\subsection{Motivation}
The rapid growth in technology and information sector in recent years has resulted in a wide range of connectivity for various electronic and heterogeneous devices that can communicate effortlessly with each other over the internet.This is what is called as 'Internet of Things'\cite{3}.\\ \\
Due to this growth in technology,we can experience a exponential growth in the usage of devices in upcoming years that can rule over the internet.\\ \\
This technological improvement has made a gateway for various different industrial sectors including Healthcare inculcate IoT with varied applications leading to new possibilities.\\ \\
According to the recent research in healthcare industries,the life expectancy is said to increase by 31\% and the aged population is said to increase by 16\% which can result in highly vulnerable population that are prone to chronic and other diseases resulting in a large percentage of deaths and global burden inturn leading to the shortage of healthcare workforce in upcoming years.\\ \\
With this aim,several healthcare frameworks have been developed based on Internet of Healthcare Technology that can provide improved and reliable services with reduced cost,highly energy efficient and scalable solutions to meet the shortage of healthcare workforce and help in prevention of diseases,treatement and cure.\\ \\
Nonetheless,the various healthcare devices generate a huge amount of heterogeneous data that require special consideration in terms of different data specific processing power,quick response time and huge storage of data which can be a challenging task.\\ \\
In order overcome this challenge ,Taylor paper\cite{3}proposes a 5-Layered IoHT framework that consist of Perception,Mist,Fog,Cloud and Application which is capable of handling different routing paths for different data types that consists of realtime and offline/batch mode data providing optimal resource utilization,balanced network load and allocate resources as required by making use of Software defined networks(SDN).\\ \\
The results from the paper show that the proposed IoHT framework provide better QoS in terms of low power consumption,reduced latency and low packet drop rate leading to an efficient development for the existing \& next generation e-Healthcare systems.\\ \\
