The Rapid development in the field of internet and tehnology has resulted in a wide range of connectivity for various electronic and heterogeneous devices that can communicate effortlessly with each other over the internet.This is what is called as 'Internet of Things'. IoT is changing our life by making things smarter and easier than ever before.

This technological improvement has made a gateway for various different industrial sectors including Healthcare inculcate IoT with varied applications leading to new possibilities.\\ \\

With this aim,several healthcare frameworks have been developed based on Internet of Healthcare Technology that can provide improved and reliable services with reduced cost,highly energy efficient and scalable solutions to meet the shortage of healthcare workforce and help in prevention of diseases,treatement and cure.\\ \\

Nonetheless,the various healthcare devices generate a huge amount of heterogeneous data that require special consideration in terms of different data specific processing power,quick response time and huge storage of data which can be a challenging task.\\ \\

In order overcome this challenge,proposed paper describes a 5-Layered IoHT framework that consist of Perception,Mist,Fog,Cloud and Application which is capable of handling different routing paths for different data types that consists of realtime and offline/batch mode data providing optimal resource utilization,balanced network load and allocate resources as required by making use of Software defined networks(SDN).\\ \\

The results from the paper show that the proposed IoHT framework provide better QoS in terms of low power consumption,reduced latency and low packet drop rate leading to an efficient development for the existing \& next generation e-Healthcare systems.\\ \\

This can help modern healthcare industries grow widely by providing services to the users through eHealthcare services inspite of reduced workforce.

This also emphazises the importance of adapting modern technologies such as machine learning and data analytics to handle the increased complexity in computational analysis and ensure high QoS with low packet drop from the data generated by large heterogeneous medical devices and organizations. 

Also focuses on implementing few other factors such as privacy \& security,usage on virtualization container technologies such as Docker \& Kubernetes and making use of few middleware technologies such as Publish/subscribe system to the already existing famework that can help IoHT Framework work seemlessly with effective performance and scalable distribution of data for the IoHT based healthcare systems.
